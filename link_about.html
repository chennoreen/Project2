      <h1 class="serif"> About Tryon Beauty </h1>
      
		<p class="sansserif"> Tryon Beauty is an online cosmetic shop that have hundreds of cutting edge brand names in cosmetics, skincare, bodycare, etc. Offering the best in global beauty, we aims to help people look and feel their best. With the comprehensive products selections in Tryon Beauty people no longer have to visit every brand’s official website, rather, they can buy various different kinds of brands and products in one single online store. Moreover, we offer “Tryon” function on the website that people can get the idea of how the makeup products will actually look on themselves by uploading their face photo. For example, when shopping lipstick online, various lip colors can be confusing to audience, since they all look someway similar, also it’s hard to tell if the color fits without physically have the product. Therefore, with Tryon Beauty, people can upload their photo, choose the color they are interested in, and see how it actually look on themselves.

		<p class="sansserif">My inspiration of this “tryon” function is from the makeup app. In the makeup app, people can put on makeup on their digital image. As a result, I think of the idea of combining the cosmetic website with makeup app, that people can on the one side enjoy the quick and simple online shopping, on the other side, benefit the testing function when shopping in store. From my personal experience, “no testing” is always the biggest disadvantage when shopping online. As customers are all a wide range of colours and ethnically diverse it can be difficult to determine a perfect match without giving it a try in-store. This can not only result in a waste of time,that people have to search a lot of online review of the products, but also a waste of money, that struggling to find a correct match, and end up receiving the product that does not meet the expectation.Therefore, combining the makeup app with online shop, people will no longer having issue when doing cosmetic shopping, rather, it can be convenient and enjoyable.

		<p class="sansserif">Over the last 20 years, shopping has taken a dramatic shift from being mainly done in-store or through catalogue to a more digital format. Online shopping, although relatively new, has taken huge steps forward to become the preferred method of shopping for many customers, especially for the young generation. Therefore, The target audience is set to be young women, whose age is between 17~ 29. Most of them are university students or at the early working age.  Since young girl often spent much of time browsing around the internet, and are easily to be influenced by the online review and social influencers. To them, online shopping is relatively convenient and do not have to face people in real life. On the other hand, there are a few male audience, whose sexual preference are more of femininity, that may feel uncomfortable to shop in a cosmetic shop publically. Therefore, Considering the target audience, the design of the website have to be visually pleasing casual, and easy to understand.
